### Introduction
The goal of this project was to take existing code that was created for a website landing page and refactor (which is to improve it without changing what it does) it to improve accessibility. This exercise involved improving the web accessibility by adding in HTML semantic elements to provide clearer sections for developers and to optimize assistive technologies like screen readers to function more easily on the sight. The semantics would also aid search engines like Google to access the site easier. Refactoring the code also involved summarizing and cleaning up/beautifying the HTML and CSS to avoid repetitive code to make it more concise and easier to read.
